# cRPG

[cRPG](https://c-rpg.eu) is a mod for [Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord](https://store.steampowered.com/app/261550/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord)
that adds persistence (xp, gold, items, stats) to the multiplayer.

## Project Status

Over the years, we encountered numerous issues with Bannerlord and received minimal support from TaleWorlds, even
though we were one of the largest multiplayer mods. I've decided to value my time a little more and discontinue my
work on this project. An active fork of the project is available at [namidaka/crpg](https://github.com/namidaka/crpg),
which is reusing the entire infrastructure, including the database and the website.
